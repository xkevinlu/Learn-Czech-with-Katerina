                  	<p><strong>My Approach</strong></p>
                    <p>I want to support you in achieving the personal goals that motivate you in learning Czech. Private tutoring offers unique advantages: I tailor my lessons to the needs of each student. To accomplish that, I provide 30 minutes of free evaluation session for new students. This will allow me to understand my students goals.
                    The method I use will be adapted to both your level and your personal objectives. You will enjoy a modern and dynamic way of Czech teaching. Besides textbooks, I use various pedagogic tools such as audio and Czech newspapers and movies. I also use games and exercises to enhance students understanding of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
                    My teaching philosophy is to emphasize my students ability to express themselves in a simple manner in a few lessons. I teach the necessary skills for them to feel comfortable communicating with people on a daily basis. In the meantime, they will continue learning more detailed knowledge of the basics and grammar of the Czech language.</p>

                    <p>Do not feel disadvantaged if you are not multi-lingual. With my guidance, you will be able to attain your goals and to speak Czech soon!</p>

					                  <p>"Simply put, Katerina is an AWESOME tutor!  It was a pleasure to learn from Katerina for the past five months in preparation for my move to Prague.  I definitely appreciated Katerina's teaching style, largely due to her being a great person with tons of teaching experience.
                            Katerina has an in-depth understanding of how a native english speaker approaches learning a slavic language, which is terribly important in my opinion.  Learning Czech is obviously not the same as learning a latin based language, but there are similarities and Katerina uses them strategically to benefit her student when teaching.
                          We used a workbook that is very practical for Czech beginners and easy to work from independently.  She is also a patient teacher, and quite willing to work with your schedule and learning habits.
                        Lastly, she was always willing to answer specific questions about cultural differences or practical scenarios that are good to know for life in the Czech Republic.  I would be lucky to find a tutor as great as Katerina during my time in Prague."</p>

					                  <p>Dont let her married name fool you: Katerina Lu is an excellent teacher of the Czech language, culture and history. You get the whole package. I am writing this endorsement from Prague, where I have moved to teach English, and have been able to completely assimilate because of my newly realized ability to speak, understand and write in Czech. Plus, the more I learn about teaching English as a Foreign Language, the more I realize how effective Katerina Lu is as a teacher.</p>

					                  <p>I was initially hesitant to get lessons from a tutor, but I finally decided it was the best option before moving to Prague. Trying to learn the language myself was not effective. And had I known how useful and FUN these lessons would be, I would've started much sooner. I only took about 16 lessons with Katerina, but learned enough to handle myself in common situations.
                             I have only been in Prague for a week now, and I already feel more comfortable getting around with the basic language I have. Katerina is an excellent tutor. The books she uses are comprehensive and user-friendly. You have to do work on your own to make the most out of lesson time, but Katerina will move at your pace and go over whatever you need to understand the language and concepts.
                           She knows what she is talking about and is able to get meaning across in many different ways, using several different methods. I learned a lot in a short period of time, and thoroughly enjoyed going in to my lesson every week. I am just sorry I can't keep taking lessons with her here in Prague! I highly recommend taking lessons from her if you are trying to learn Czech, on any time table!</p>

									            <p>Czech language, in the past sometimes also called Bohemian, member of the West Slavic group of the Slavic subfamily of the Indo-European family of languages. The official language of the Czech Republic, it is spoken by about 11 million people, of whom over 10 million reside there and close to 1 million of whom are in Slovakia and North America combined.

															Grammatically, Czech has seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, instrumental, and vocative) for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. It is not necessary to use personal pronouns with verbs since the verb endings clearly show person and number; however, personal pronouns may be used for emphasis. In the pronunciation of Czech, the stress always falls on the first syllable of a word, but diacritical marks such as accents do not show this accentuation. A sharp distinction is made between long and short vowels, and an acute accent (´) is used to indicate where vowels are lengthened, i.e., where their pronunciation is relatively protracted. A hook or inverted circumflex over a consonant is the sign that the consonant is palatalized, or pronounced with the tip of the tongue on the palate.

															The earliest surviving record of Czech is in the form of glosses in a Latin manuscript of the 11th cent. AD The period of Old Czech, the oldest stage of the language, is usually placed in the 11th to 14th cents. At that time there were many dialects. A Czech literature began to take shape in the 13th cent. Standardization of the spelling and pronunciation of the language occurred during the Middle Czech period of the 15th and 16th cents, primarily as a result of the work of John (Jan) Hus, the celebrated Czech religious reformer, who made the Prague dialect the basis of his far-reaching linguistic reforms. The modern period of Czech began in the 17th cent. The domination of the Czechs by the Hapsburg rulers of Austria from 1620 to 1918 severely hampered the development of the Czech language and literature, although a national literary revival began in the 18th cent.

															After independence was regained in 1918, the language and literature of Czechoslovakia again began to flourish. Czech was one of two official languages (the other being Slovak) of Czechoslovakia and remained the official language of the Czech Republic after Czechoslovakia was dissolved in 1993. A modified version of the Roman alphabet is used for writing Czech. </p>

<p><strong>If I had a "Frequently Asked Questions" page ...This would be the #1 question:</strong></p>

<p>
“Can you make an exception and teach me in the evening and/or on the weekends…?”   Well, I really can not. That is because my husband and I spend our evenings and most of our weekends practicing and competing in Ballroom Dancing. We are the Senior US Ballroom Champions. We are three times Senior British Open (Blackpool) Champions (out of 200+ couples), World Championships finalist, three times International Championships (London) winners. We are very, very dedicated to our hobby…   So … NO, I really can not teach in the evenings, nor on the weekends. I love teaching, but I love dancing too. Thank you for your understanding and here are some pictures of us dancing…</p>
